        testimony: <p>"IW 2021 <b className='text-lg'>was an excellent experience</b> for my team and me. It was such a roller coaster for us since it was held online, and we couldn't face each other how we were supposed to. Nevertheless, the event sequence and webinar are interesting to hear and attend. The insightful information that we dig from the study case and <b className='text-lg'>the beauty of the expert's feedback helps us understand</b> how much we are still far from perfect and triggers us to keep developing. Thank you, IW, for the unforgettable experience! <b className='text-lg'>10/10 for IW UGM!</b>"</p>

        testimony: <p>"We faced many challenges and surprising moments here at IW UGM, such as bridging the gap between digitalization through technology to help small middle businesses in Indonesia, real company study case provided by Telkomsel IoT to solve the lack of knowledge about IoT innovation and the Telkomsel IoT manufacturer issues in Indonesia. All of those experiences are <b className='text-lg'>really recommended to those interested in solving case studies</b> by giving unique ideas through creation. For me, “Better to try than never,” lastly join IW UGM to <b className='text-lg'>feel and test your solving problem skill</b> as a college student. Thank you!"</p>
